<p>Like many African countries, Togo's history is one of migration, conquests, ethnic conflicts, colonization, independence, strongman rule, failed coups and a democracy hampered by corruption.</p>

<p>Among the tribes migrating from the north between the 7th and 12th centuries were the Kabye (Kabre), the Lambas and small numbers of Hausa who brought Islam to Togo. The Ewe, one of the major groups in Togo, came from the Yoruba area in modern-day southwestern Nigeria and Benin and first settled in the Mono River valley. The northern part of Togo was, for a long time, under the influence of Islamic kingdoms, such as that of Umar Tal (Tukulor empire) in the 19th century.</p>

<p>During the period known as the "Scramble for Africa," in 1884, the territory of what is now Togo, including most of today's Volta region of Ghana, became a protectorate of the German Empire named Togoland, until August 1914 when French and British troops invaded said Togoland. In 1922, Togoland was divided into a French and a British administrative zone under a League of Nations mandate. In 1946, the two zones became United Nations trust territories. French Togoland became independent as the Republic of Togo in 1960.</p>
