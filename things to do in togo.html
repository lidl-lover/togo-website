<p> this is going to tell you about the top three things things you can do in togo,Lome. Number one, the grand marche, Enjoy the hectic market environment. I just bought a ton of mangoes and browsed around eating them in the midday sun. You can buy snacks, meals, clothes, meat, vegetables, purses, baskets…anything!Don’t forget to bring plenty of water, or of course you can buy it at the market.You can also chat with the vendors and learn about their lives. Some travel in for the market, and others live locally.I found that as a tourist people generally left me alone in the market unless I initiated a conversation. It was a lovely chaotic market, but it was not intimidating.The Grand Marché is authentically Togolese and a must do for anybody who visits Lomé.</p>

<p>number 2 The Lome Cathedral, The Lomé Cathedral looms over the Grand Marché and so you can easily visit it while exploring the market. Did you know that Togo was once a German colony? This cathedral attests to this complicated colonial history that still affects the lives of the Togolese today and to top it off the Lome cathedral is very tidy and in great condition.</p>

<p> Number three the Monument de l’Independence, Although it takes just a few minutes to see, I think seeing the Monument de l’Independence is still one of the best things to do in Lomé. It is a beautiful monument in the center of a large traffic circle and represents the end of colonial rule in Togo.To tell you the truth, the area is gated and so you can’t go inside to get a close up view. But you are bound to drive by it while  navigating around the other things to do in Lomé!</p>
